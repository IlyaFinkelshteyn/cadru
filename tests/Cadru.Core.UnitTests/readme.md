Package restore for this project will probably fail for now as the other Cadru packages it depends on aren't published to NuGet yet. I have a local NuGet pakcage source that just points to a directory where I drop the generated packages. Ideally, I don't want to even have to do that much as I should be able to just add references to the projects directly, but that doesn't work correctly yet.
